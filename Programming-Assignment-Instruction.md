# Programming Assignment Instruction

## TODO list

- [ ] Play with the path finding game following the instructions. For now, BFS and DFS algorithms are complete to play;
- [ ] Implement Dijkstra's algorithm in src/search.py;
- [ ] Implement A* algorithm in src/search.py;
- [ ] Create a repo in your github account and upload the code. You can use the name grid-map-pathfinder as it is or some other fancy name.

## Hint

The code used in Dijkstra's or A* algorithm is very similar to the one in BFS. You can start from there by copying the code in bfs().
