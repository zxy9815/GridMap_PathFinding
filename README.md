# Search-based Path Planning / Path Finding Algorithms with Visualization

## Overview

A playground for interacting with these path planning / path finding algorithms as below,

- BFS
- DFS
- Dijkstra
- A* (A star)

### grid-map-pathfinder

Under this folder, a grid map which can be resizable is used to display the algorithm working.

### geometric-map-pathfinder

Under this folder, a geometric map is used and then the coordinates need to be converted to grid indexes before applying the path finding algorithms.

The python files are copied from [PythonRobotics](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics) repository.
